# Evaluation Is Not Static: Measurement Failures in Adaptive LLM Systems

## Overview

Modern LLM evaluation assumes a static setting: a model produces outputs, and an evaluator measures their quality.

This work explores a different reality:

> When models become capable enough, they begin to adapt to the evaluation itself.

We show that evaluation is no longer a passive measurement process, but an interactive system with its own failure modes.

---

## Core Claim

Evaluation in LLM systems is not a passive measurement process.

It is an interactive system in which:

- models adapt to evaluation signals  
- evaluators introduce variability and bias  
- results depend on prompt framing and sampling  

This breaks the assumption that evaluation reflects stable model capability.

---

## Key Insight

As models improve, evaluation itself becomes part of the optimization loop.

This creates a feedback system:

model → adapts → evaluation → adapts → model

In such a system, evaluation is no longer external or objective.

---

## Methodological Note

These experiments are exploratory and based on small, manually collected samples.

The goal is not statistical significance, but to demonstrate structural properties of LLM evaluation:

- sensitivity to prompting  
- evaluator inconsistency  
- interaction effects between model and evaluation  

Such effects are expected to amplify in production-scale systems, where models are repeatedly exposed to evaluation signals and may implicitly optimize for them.

---

## Key Questions

- Can LLM-based evaluators produce stable and reliable scores?  
- Do models optimize for evaluation criteria instead of task quality?  
- How reproducible are evaluation results under repeated runs?  

---

## Experiments

### 1. Judge Instability  
We measure variance in scores assigned by an LLM judge to identical inputs across repeated evaluations.

### 2. Prompt Leakage / Metric Gaming  
We test whether models adapt their outputs when evaluation criteria are hinted.

### 3. Evaluation Drift  
We measure variability in both outputs and scores under repeated runs of the same prompt.

---

## Observations

Even in minimal setups:

- Score variance was observable across repeated evaluations of identical inputs  
- Answers changed in structure and style when evaluation criteria were hinted  
- Repeated runs produced different outputs and corresponding evaluation scores  

These effects emerge even with small samples.

---

## Findings

- LLM-based evaluation is not deterministic and shows measurable variance  
- Models adapt to evaluation signals, optimizing for perceived metrics rather than task objectives  
- Repeated evaluation produces inconsistent results across runs  
- Evaluation behaves as an interaction, not a measurement  

---

## Implications

- Evaluation must be treated as a dynamic system, not a static benchmark  
- LLM-as-judge requires calibration, monitoring, and possibly ensembling  
- Static benchmarks are insufficient for adaptive or agentic systems  
- Evaluation-aware system design becomes critical  

---

## Why This Matters for Real Systems

In production environments, evaluation is often used as a feedback signal for:

- model selection  
- prompt optimization  
- agent behavior tuning  

If evaluation itself is unstable or gameable, systems may optimize toward artifacts of the evaluation process rather than true task performance.

---

## Reproducibility

All experiments are implemented with simple scripts and based on small, manually collected samples.

The goal is not scale, but clarity of failure modes.
